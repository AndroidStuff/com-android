# Circle of Music Android App
___
Circle of Music or CoM which we like to call it, is a music sharing application developed by Siddhant Gupta(Backend dev and Android dev),Saumil Sachdeva(Android dev), and Sameer Vaze(Graphic Designer). The main purpose of the app is to share music amongst a circle of 4-5 people. 

HOW IT WORKS!
A user uploads a track that he loves& which he has on his device, and thus shares it in the circle. Now other users that are part of the circle and see the shared track, stream it and download it to their own devices. 

HOW IT DIFFERS FROM OTHER MUSIC APPS!
1. The less number of people means you share your music with people having similar taste as yours.
2. The fact that you upload a song that you've in your device and not a link, shows that you share music that you genuinely love and not what is trending.
3. By downloading that song, user can listen to it even when he's offline.
