## About
Circle of Music or CoM which we like to call it, is a music sharing application developed by Siddhant Gupta, Saumil Sachdeva, and Sameer Vaze. The main purpose of the app is to share music amongst a circle of people with similiar music interests. 

## How it works
A user uploads a track that they love & which they have on their device, and thus share it in the circle. Now other users who are part of the circle and see the shared track, stream it and download it to their own devices. 

## How it differs from others
* The less number of people means you share your music with people having similar taste as your.s
* The fact that you upload a song that you've in your device and not a link, shows that you share music that you genuinely love and not what is trending.
* By downloading that song, user can listen to it even when he's offline.
