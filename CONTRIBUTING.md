## Always pr to the development branch when resolving an issue or completing an enhancement, because the master branch is protected ;) . 

### Before you contribute

For a list of features already pending use the Issue tracker and start work on any of the "Enhancement" tagged issues.

If you are new and would like to do basic small jobs look for the "basic" tag on an issue and try to fix it (which should be easy) and if you need any help , just leave a comment.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
